# Model-Optimization
The jupyter notebooks contain python code that illustrates how to optimize a machine learning model using parameters
1. logistic-heart.pdf contains a dataset with information that i used to predict those who are positive and those
   who are not using a machine learning model that i later optimized
   It also compares the accuracy of the initial model with that of the best model as indicated in the pdf
   
2. linear-ecom-customers.pdf contains a dataset with information that i used to predict the time average money spent by online e-commerce customers
   depending on the average time spent on their devices online and on the e-commerce websites
  > the accuracies are also compared
