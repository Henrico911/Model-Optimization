# Model-Optimization
The jupyter notebooks contain python code that illustrates how to optimize a machine learning model using parameters
1. logistic-heart.pdf contains a dataset with information that i used to predict thise who are posituve and those
   who are not using a machine learning model that i later optimized
   It also compares the accuracy of the initial model with that of the best model as indicated in the pdf
